    {
      question: 'How do credits work?',
      answer: 'Credits are consumed when you perform actions like email finding or verification. Different actions consume different amounts of credits. Unused credits roll over to the next month.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?',
      answer: "Yes, you can change your plan at any time. When upgrading, you'll be prorated for the remainder of the billing cycle. When downgrading, the new rate will apply to your next billing cycle."
    },
    {
      question: 'Do credits expire?',
      answer: 'Credits roll over month to month as long as you maintain an active paid subscription. Free plan credits expire at the end of each month.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What happens if I run out of credits?',
      answer: 'You can purchase additional credits at any time, or upgrade to a higher plan with more credits included.'
